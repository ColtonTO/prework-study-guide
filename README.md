# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

- My motivation for making this study guide was to introduce myself to basic programming languages. These programming languages include: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- I built this project to not only make a simple web-based study guide, but to learn basics in the three programming languages above. 
- This project solves three main problems. How to use HTML to structure a webpage, how to use CSS to style a webpage, using Git to update branches of the project, and how to use JavaScript to make a webpage function. 
- I learnt everything that was made in this project from the ground up through Module 3.0 on building a simple web application. 
- This prework study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the prework.

To use this study guide, you simply review notes under each section. Sections include: HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript. If you need any suggestions on what to study, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I (windows) and Command+Option+I (MacOS). Another way to do this is by simply right clicking anywhere on the screen and clicking "inspect element", then clicking the "console" button under the DevTools tab, located on the right side of the screen. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion of which topic to study.
